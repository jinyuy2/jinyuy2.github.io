    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus, 
    the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
    The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. 
    The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19 transmits when people breathe air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. 
    The risk of breathing these is highest when people are in close proximity, 
    but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. 
    Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, 
    nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, 
    and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further study whether there is an association between confirmed cases and deaths for COVID-19; 
    if so, what the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths will be (linear or otherwise); 
    and whether the gradient for confirmed cases and deaths is constant over time. 
    This website will visualize the data with some charts and present the detailed information in the Interactive Slideshow way.
